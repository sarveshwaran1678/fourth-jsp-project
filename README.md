This is an advanced project on my version of how wholesalers and farmers can sell and buy goods and products.
During the project I realised that this project cannot have any real world application. I couldn't stop half way. So this is my Final version of the project.




The key features of this project for both farmers and wholesalers are:

0)Step by Step detail on how website works in the home page.

1)To register themselves online and OTP generated mail to their mail ID.

2)To add/delete the items to sell or buy in the cart. -- based on crop type,crop name,crop variety,number of quintals,cost per quintals.

3)Search for potential buyers/sellers after adding in cart.quaintals

4)Make deals and get notifications on the location and contact deatils of sellers / buyers.

5)Keep track of Statistics of crops sold,added to cart,deleted from cart,notifications recived,request's made.

6)Can add current location using Google maps API. which is useful later to plot routue between buyer and seller.

7)History to keep track of crops added/deleted/sold/incart/Deatils of past deals.
